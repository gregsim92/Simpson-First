	<h3>Plans for the Future</h3>
			<p>I'm looking forward to improving my fluency with programming languages and rounding out my skillset. I'm always marvelling about how quickly software is improving and all of the new ways everyday services are becoming easier and more for the average person. My goal is to use my newfound skills and combine them with the things that I learned in college to become either a software developer of a product manager. </p>
		
	<h3>Goals</h3>
			<p>While not professional goals, one day I would like to go on a longstay tour in the far east. I wish to continue my travels and continue to visit distant countries.</p>
		
	<h3>How I feel about deciding to pursue gSchool</h3>
			<p>Pretty Darn Good</p>
