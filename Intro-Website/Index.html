	<h2>My name is Greg Simpson</h2>
		<p>I am 23 years old, and a California native. I was born and raised in Sonoma County, where most of my family still lives. Nowadays I'm living in the East Bay. After graduating high school my family and I moved to France! During that time I started college and spent my time traveling Europe. My favorite places that I visited were definitely Dubrovnich, the Swiss alps, and Munich.  <strong>OKTOBERFEST!!</strong>.
		<p>After around two years I moved back to the USA to finish my studies and ended up studying over in New Jersey to finish my bachelor's degree. While studying there I took some CIS classes, where I learned the basics of Visual Basic and SQL. These courses piqued my interest in programming languages, which lead me here!</p>
